# main.py

# Welcome to your learning project!
# This is your main Python file where you'll write your code.
# You can use the built-in csv and math modules for data processing and calculations.

# Example of importing required modules
import csv
import math


def main():
    """
    Main function - this is where your program starts.
    You can read CSV files, perform calculations, and process data here.
    """
    print("Learning Project Started")
    
    # TODO: Add your code here
    # Example tasks you might do:
    # 1. Read data from a CSV file
    # 2. Perform calculations using the math module
    # 3. Process and analyze the data
    # 4. Output results


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # This is the standard way to call the main function in Python
    # It ensures the code only runs when the script is executed directly
    main()
