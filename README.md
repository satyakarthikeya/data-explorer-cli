# Learning Project

## Project Description
This is a beginner-level learning project designed to help you practice Python programming fundamentals. You'll work with CSV data files and use mathematical functions to process and analyze information.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Built-in CSV module
- Built-in Math module

## Project Goals
- Practice reading and processing CSV files
- Use mathematical functions for data analysis
- Develop basic Python programming skills

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Program successfully reads data from a CSV file
- [ ] At least 3 different mathematical calculations are performed using the math module
- [ ] Data is processed and meaningful output is generated
- [ ] Code follows Python best practices and is well-commented
- [ ] Program runs without errors

## Getting Started
1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed
2. Run the program with: `python src/main.py`
3. Add your implementation in the main.py file
