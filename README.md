=====================================================

## Description
The Data Explorer CLI is a command-line interface tool designed for loading, viewing, and performing basic statistical operations on CSV datasets. This project is ideal for introducing core programming concepts while mimicking early-stage data handling typical in AI/ML workflows. By working with the Data Explorer CLI, users can gain hands-on experience with data manipulation and analysis using Python.

## Features
* Load CSV datasets from local files
* View dataset statistics, including mean, median, and standard deviation
* Perform basic data filtering and sorting operations
* Interactive menu-driven user interface for easy navigation

## Tech Stack
The Data Explorer CLI is built using the following technologies:
* **Primary**: Python 3.x
* **Secondary**:
	+ CSV module (built-in) for handling CSV file operations
	+ Math module (built-in) for mathematical functions and calculations

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x installed on your system
* A CSV file containing the dataset you want to explore

### Installation
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-explorer-cli.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd data-explorer-cli`
3. Install any dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if required)

### Usage
1. Run the Data Explorer CLI using `python data_explorer.py`
2. Follow the interactive menu prompts to load your CSV dataset and perform various operations

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:
```markdown
data-explorer-cli/
|---- data_explorer.py
|---- utils.py
|---- datasets/
|       |---- example.csv
|---- README.md
|---- LICENSE
```
